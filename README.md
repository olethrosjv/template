school project website

Ace in the Hole Multisport Events is a company that runs a two-day multisport event that has triathlons and running events of varying distances. They are looking for a new site that showcases this unique event. They need a way for both athletes (participants) and volunteers to sign up for the event, the integration of their social media, a weather feed, and a dynamic picture gallery of images.
